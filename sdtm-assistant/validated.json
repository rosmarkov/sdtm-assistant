{"source_field": "VSORRES", "validated_target_field": "VSORRES", "transformation_needed": false, "improved_transformation_description": "No transformation required as the source field directly maps to the SDTM target field.", "improved_reasoning": "The source field VSORRES, which stands for 'Result or Finding in Original Units' in a clinical study context, aligns with the SDTM VS domain's variable VSORRES that captures the same information. Since it reflects the original observed result without any need for conversion or reinterpretation, a direct mapping is appropriate and no additional transformation is necessary.", "validation_comments": "The mapping is correct; however, ensure that original units conform to any necessary controlled terminology or unit standards specified by the study protocol or regulatory guidance. If there are specific unit preferences or required terminology, they should be documented and verified as compliant with SDTM standards."}
{"source_field": "VSORRESU", "validated_target_field": "VSORRESU", "transformation_needed": true, "improved_transformation_description": "Ensure that the values in VSORRESU conform to the SDTM controlled terminology for the unit of measurement.", "improved_reasoning": "While VSORRESU from the source maps directly to VSORRESU in SDTM, controlled terminology compliance is necessary for standardization across datasets. Units in VSORRESU should match the expected SDTM units.", "validation_comments": "The mapping is mostly correct; however, it's crucial to ensure compliance with SDTM controlled terminology to maintain data consistency. Even if direct, validating units against SDTM controlled terms is necessary."}
{"source_field": "VSSEQ", "validated_target_field": "VSSEQ", "transformation_needed": false, "improved_transformation_description": "No transformation is required as VSSEQ is a sequence number field that aligns directly with the SDTM standard.", "improved_reasoning": "The VSSEQ source field is used to maintain the order of the vital signs records in both the source and SDTM datasets. In SDTM, the VSSEQ variable directly corresponds to the sequence variable from the source data ensuring record uniqueness. No controlled terminology is necessary in this context as it is merely an identifier for sequencing.", "validation_comments": "The mapping of VSSEQ to VSSEQ with no transformation is correct. The purpose of VSSEQ is to maintain the sequence of vital signs records, and its straightforward nature does not require any additional transformation or controlled terminology mapping."}
{"source_field": "VSTEST", "validated_target_field": "VSTESTCD", "transformation_needed": true, "improved_transformation_description": "Map VSTEST to corresponding controlled terminology VSTESTCD code.", "improved_reasoning": "In SDTM, the VSTEST field should be represented as VSTESTCD, which requires using a controlled terminology that includes a standard code for each vital sign test. Therefore, a transformation is needed to map the collected test name to its corresponding short code.", "validation_comments": "The initial mapping incorrectly retained the use of VSTEST directly. However, according to SDTM guidelines, VSTESTCD should represent the standardized test code. Controlled terminology provided by CDISC should be employed to ensure consistency and accuracy."}
{"source_field": "VSTESTCD", "validated_target_field": "VSTESTCD", "transformation_needed": false, "improved_transformation_description": "No transformation is needed as VSTESTCD is an SDTM standard code for the test name short version in the VS (Vital Signs) domain.", "improved_reasoning": "The source field VSTESTCD aligns directly with the target SDTM field VSTESTCD, which is used to represent the short name of a vital sign test code as per the SDTM standard. There is no need for transformation as long as controlled terminology aligns with the CDISC SDTM controlled terminology standards for VSTESTCD.", "validation_comments": "Ensure that the values used in VSTESTCD follow CDISC SDTM controlled terminology to maintain consistency and compliance with CDISC standards."}
