This applies if VSORRESU values need to adhere to standard unit conventions, which should be verified against CDISC controlled terminology."}
{"source_field": "VSSEQ", "validated_target_field": "VSSEQ", "transformation_needed": false, "improved_transformation_description": "No transformation is needed since VSSEQ, a sequence number field, directly maps between CDMS and SDTM.", "improved_reasoning": "VSSEQ is a sequence number typically used in both the CDMS and SDTM to uniquely identify records within a subject's dataset. Since it serves the same purpose in both contexts, a direct mapping is appropriate and consistent with SDTM convention.", "validation_comments": "The proposed mapping of VSSEQ to VSSEQ is appropriate. Sequence numbers are intended to be unique identifiers and do not require transformation. Since this mapping involves a numerical sequence number, controlled terminology mapping is not applicable. The mapping maintains the integrity of the dataset structure by ensuring that the sequence order of records is preserved through the mapping process."}
{"source_field": "VSTEST", "validated_target_field": "VSTESTCD", "transformation_needed": true, "improved_transformation_description": "Map VSTEST to VSTESTCD using controlled terminology. Assign the appropriate code for each vital sign test.", "improved_reasoning": "The source field VSTEST contains the name of the vital signs test, which needs to be mapped to a coded representation in SDTM. The VSTESTCD field in SDTM requires controlled terminology, meaning we need to map each test name from VSTEST to its corresponding code in the SDTM controlled terminology set.", "validation_comments": "The original mapping directly mapped VSTEST to VSTEST, which does not align with the SDTMIG requirement to use coded values for the VSTESTCD field. It is essential to apply controlled terminology to ensure consistency and compliance with SDTM standards."}
{"source_field": "VSTESTCD", "validated_target_field": "VSTESTCD", "transformation_needed": false, "improved_transformation_description": "No transformation is needed as the source field VSTESTCD aligns directly with the target field per SDTMIG 3.3 standards, but controlled terminology should be used.", "improved_reasoning": "The VSTESTCD source field should map directly to the VSTESTCD target field in SDTM since VSTESTCD is intended to represent the unique code for each Vital Signs test and serves as the primary source field. However, it is crucial to ensure that the values in VSTESTCD adhere to the SDTM controlled terminology to maintain consistency and data integration standards. This reinforces the need to adhere to controlled terminology even when a direct match is apparent.", "validation_comments": "Mapping is generally correct but it is essential to verify that the source field values comply with SDTM's controlled terminology for VSTESTCD. However, no additional transformation of data format or structure is required, only a verification against controlled terms."}
