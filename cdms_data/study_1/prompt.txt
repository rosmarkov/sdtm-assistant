You are a clinical data manager.

Generate synthetic, realistic raw CDMS datasets for a clinical trial covering the following domains:
- DM (Demographics)
- VS (Vital Signs)
- AE (Adverse Events)
- EX (Exposure)
- TS (Trial Summary)
- TV (Trial Visits)

Requirements:
- Create realistic and complete sets of fields typically collected at the CDMS level based on your domain knowledge.
- Do NOT limit the number of fields; reflect actual clinical trialdata collection practices and include diverse metadata (e.g., demographics, vital measurements, event severities, dosing routes).
- Output each domain as a realistic **CSV format** block: a header row followed by data rows.
- Each domain should include 10-20 records, multiple subjects, and multiple visits where appropriate.
- Include missing/null values in some fields realistically.
- Clearly label each section with "DM Dataset:", "VS Dataset:", "AE Dataset:", etc.

Respond only with the CSV content clearly separated by domain - no explanations, introductions, or notes.

Be as accurate and complete as possible.
